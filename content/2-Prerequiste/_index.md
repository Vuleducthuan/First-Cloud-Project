To implement CloudFront Advanced Caching and Security, we need to prepare the basic infrastructure, including an S3 bucket to store the static website and a CloudFront Distribution to deliver content through AWSâ€™s global edge network. In addition, we need to configure appropriate IAM Roles and Policies to ensure that CloudFront, Lambda@Edge, and S3 can interact securely.
