**Amazon CloudFront** is AWS’s powerful Content Delivery Network (CDN), designed to deliver content with low latency and high performance worldwide. But CloudFront is more than just speed — it offers two strategic capabilities: **Advanced Caching** and **Security**, helping to optimize traffic flow, reduce costs, and protect systems against modern threats.

## Advanced Caching

CloudFront provides customizable caching strategies to reduce origin load and improve response time:

- **Caching based on custom parameters**: Cache can be tailored using `query strings`, `cookies`, `headers`, or `device types` (mobile/desktop).
- **Cache Policies & Origin Request Policies**: Separate what affects cache key versus what is forwarded to the origin → minimizes unnecessary cache misses.
- **Lambda@Edge / CloudFront Functions**: Run logic at edge locations (e.g., redirects, token validation, URL rewrites) without needing to contact the origin.
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data fields at the edge → only the origin can decrypt them.

 *Effective caching = Faster responses + Reduced server load + Lower costs.*

## Security Features

CloudFront is tightly integrated with AWS’s security ecosystem to provide comprehensive protection for your content and users:

- **AWS WAF**: A web application firewall that blocks SQL injection, XSS, bots, and layer 7 DDoS attacks.
- **Geo Restriction**: Restrict content access based on geographic regions — useful for licensing and regional control.
- **HTTPS & TLS (SSL Certificates)**: Full HTTPS support with customizable SSL certificates and the latest TLS versions.
- **Signed URLs / Signed Cookies**: Deliver private content securely with time-limited access mechanisms.
- **AWS Shield Standard**: Built-in, no-cost protection against layer 3 and 4 DDoS attacks on all distributions.

*CloudFront is not just fast — it’s fortified with robust security capabilities.*
