Testing with the command sudo tcpdump -nn port 22 and sudo tcpdump we will see no SSH traffic but only HTTPS traffic. Above, we have created a connection to the public instance without opening SSH port 22, for better security, avoiding any attack to the SSH port.\nOne disadvantage of the above method is that we have to open the Security Group outbound at port 443 to the internet. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a public instance, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem, but if you want extra security, you can block port 443 to the internet and still use the Session Manager.

	"description": "",
	"content": "🚀 Introduction Amazon CloudFront is AWS’s powerful Content Delivery Network (CDN), designed to deliver content with low latency and high performance worldwide. But CloudFront is more than just speed — it offers two strategic capabilities: Advanced Caching and Security, helping to optimize traffic flow, reduce costs, and protect systems against modern threats.\n🔁 Advanced Caching CloudFront provides customizable caching strategies to reduce origin load and improve response time:\nCaching based on custom parameters: Cache can be tailored using query strings, cookies, headers, or device types (mobile/desktop). Cache Policies \u0026amp; Origin Request Policies: Separate what affects cache key versus what is forwarded to the origin → minimizes unnecessary cache misses. Lambda@Edge / CloudFront Functions: Run logic at edge locations (e.g., redirects, token validation, URL rewrites) without needing to contact the origin. Field-Level Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data fields at the edge → only the origin can decrypt them. ⏱️ Effective caching = Faster responses + Reduced server load + Lower costs.\n🔒 Security Features CloudFront is tightly integrated with AWS’s security ecosystem to provide comprehensive protection for your content and users:\nAWS WAF: A web application firewall that blocks SQL injection, XSS, bots, and layer 7 DDoS attacks. Geo Restriction: Restrict content access based on geographic regions — useful for licensing and regional control. HTTPS \u0026amp; TLS (SSL Certificates): Full HTTPS support with customizable SSL certificates and the latest TLS versions. Signed URLs / Signed Cookies: Deliver private content securely with time-limited access mechanisms. AWS Shield Standard: Built-in, no-cost protection against layer 3 and 4 DDoS attacks on all distributions. 🛡️ CloudFront is not just fast — it’s fortified with robust security capabilities.\n✅ Conclusion CloudFront is a modern CDN that delivers not only speed, but also deep caching customization and enterprise-grade security for both static and dynamic applications. It\u0026rsquo;s an ideal solution for protecting and accelerating any web application at a global scale.\n💡 Tip: When deploying CloudFront, leverage tools like CloudFront Insights, Real-Time Logs, and CloudWatch Monitoring to gain full visibility into caching behavior and security posture in real time.\n"
